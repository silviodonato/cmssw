# Digi collections to HGCalDigiSoA

`HGCalDataFrameToHGCalDigiSoA` reads the legacy `HGCalDigiCollection`,
including `simHGCalUnsuppressedDigis:EE:HLT`. It emits a
`hgcaldigi::HGCalDigiHost` and a row-aligned `detIds` vector. Each input
frame produces one row. The default sample index is 2, the in-time sample
used by legacy HGCal rec-hit reconstruction. Set `sampleIndex` to select a
different sample. An absent input collection produces empty outputs.

The converter copies ADC-mode data to `adc`, ToT-mode data to `tot`, and a
valid ToA to `toa`. It copies the preceding ADC-mode sample to `adcm1`.
It uses `tctp=2` for complete ToT and `tctp=1` for busy/in-progress ToT;
other rows use zero. `cm` is zero because the legacy frame has no common-mode
field. It marks all rows `hgcal::DIGI_FLAG::Invalid`: legacy ADC/ToT scales
and channel indexing differ from the raw-data SoA, so these are not valid
inputs to the newer HGCal reconstruction without further calibration and
mapping.

Run the HGCal example from the CMSSW area after `cmsenv` and `scram b -j 4`:

```sh
cmsRun src/RecoLocalCalo/HGCalDigiSoAConverter/test/hgcalDataFrameToHGCalDigiSoA_cfg.py
```

It reads one event from the supplied file and writes
`hgcalDataFrameToHGCalDigiSoA.root`.

## QIE10 input

`QIE10ToHGCalDigiSoA` reads a `QIE10DigiCollection` (the
`HcalDataFrameContainer<io_v1::QIE10DataFrame>` product) and emits a
`hgcaldigi::HGCalDigiHost`, the persistable host collection for
`HGCalDigiSoA`. It also emits `std::vector<uint32_t>` with instance name
`detIds`, in the same row order as the SoA.

The `hltHgcalDigis:EE` branch in the example file is a separate
`HGCalDigiCollection`; this producer consumes `hltHcalDigis` instead.

Each input frame produces one row. The producer selects the sample marked
SOI, falling back to sample zero if none is marked. It copies that sample's
ADC to `adc`, the preceding sample's ADC (or zero) to `adcm1`, and the raw
leading-edge TDC count to `toa`. It sets `tctp`, `tot`, and `cm` to zero and
`flags` to `hgcal::DIGI_FLAG::Invalid`. QIE10 and HGCal digitizers use
different encodings; this output is intended for studying the SoA layout and
is not a calibrated HGCal digi for reconstruction. The QIE10 trailing-edge
TDC, CAPID, and status bits are not represented in this layout.

From the CMSSW area, run:

```sh
cmsenv
scram b -j 4
cmsRun src/RecoLocalCalo/HGCalDigiSoAConverter/test/qie10ToHGCalDigiSoA_cfg.py
```

The example reads two events from the supplied file and writes only the SoA
and its `detIds` product to `qie10ToHGCalDigiSoA.root`.
The first event has no QIE10 product and produces an empty SoA; the second
has 3,456 frames.
